I’m a **Data Scientist** specializing in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Document Intelligence**, with hands-on experience building **production-ready, scalable ML systems**. My work focuses on predictive modeling, OCR-driven automation, and end-to-end ML pipelines that translate advanced analytics into **measurable business impact**.

### 💼 Professional Experience
At **ING Türkiye**, I designed and deployed predictive models that:
- Expanded portfolio coverage by **55%**
- Delivered **25–30% higher business impact**

This was achieved through advanced feature engineering, drift detection, ensemble methods, and robust validation strategies. I work across the full ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment, monitoring, and explainability.

### 🧠 Areas of Expertise
- Predictive modeling & risk analytics  
- OCR-based document intelligence (PyTesseract, PaddleOCR, SpaCy NER)  
- End-to-end ML pipelines & automation  
- Recommendation systems & sentiment analysis  
- CNN-based computer vision models  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages & Core:** Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **ML / DL:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ensemble Learning  
- **LLM & NLP:** Transformers (BERT, GPT), LLM-Based Pipelines, RAG Concepts, SpaCy (NER)  
- **Document Intelligence & CV:** PyTesseract, PaddleOCR, OpenCV  
- **MLOps & Production:** CI/CD, Model Monitoring, Drift Detection, Scalable & Compliant ML Systems

I focus on building **reliable, interpretable, and business-aligned ML & AI solutions** that are ready for real-world production environments.
